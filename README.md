## Getting Started

DynaMorph utilizes a broad set of deep learning and machine learning tools to analyze cell imaging data, [pipeline](https://github.com/czbiohub/dynamorph/tree/master/pipeline) folder contains wrapper methods for easy access to the functionalities of DynaMorph. We also maintained some example scripts `run_preproc.py`, `run_segmentation.py`, `run_patch.py` and `run_VAE.py` to facilitate parallelization of data processing. Check [section](#cell-segmentation-and-tracking) below for functionalities this repo provides.

## DynaMorph Pipeline

DynaMorph starts with raw image files from cell imaging experiments and sequentially applies a set of segmentation and encoding tools. Below we briefly introduced the main processing steps.


### Label-free Imaging, Cell Segmentation, and Tracking

![pipeline_fig](pipeline.jpg)

Starting from any microscopy data (file format is .tif single-page series or multi-page stacks acquired from micro-manager) (panel A). In the dynamorph paper, we used Phase and Retardance images measured with Quantitative Label-Free Imaging with Phase and Polarization microscopy as the input.
Then use a segmentation model of your choice to generate semantic segmentation maps from the input (panel C).  

Instance segmentation in this work is based on clustering, related methods can be found in `SingleCellPatch/extract_patches.py`. Cell tracking methods can be found in `SingleCellPatch/generate_trajectories.py`.

To generate segmentation and tracking from scratch, follow steps below:

##### <a name="step1"></a> 1. (optional) prepare training images and labels for training segmentation models

##### <a name="step2"></a> 2. (optional) train a segmentation model to provide per-pixel class probabilities, see scripts in `NNsegmentation/run.py`

##### <a name="step3"></a> 3. prepare inputs as 5-D numpy arrays of shape (N<sub>time frames</sub>, N<sub>channels</sub>, N<sub>slices</sub>, height, width), see `run_preproc.py` for an example

##### <a name="step4"></a> 4. apply trained segmentation model for semantic segmentation, see method `pipeline.segmentation.segmentation` or `run_segmentation.py` 

##### <a name="step5"></a> 5. use predicted class probability maps for instance segmentation, see method `pipeline.segmentation.instance_segmentation` or `run_segmentation.py` 

### Latent Representations of Morphology
DynaMorph uses VQ-VAE to encode and reconstruct cell image patches, from which latent vectors are used as morphology descriptor.

To extract single cell patches and employ morphology encoding, follow steps below:

##### <a name="step6"></a> 6. extract cell patches based on instance segmentation, see method `pipeline.patch_VAE.extract_patches` or `run_patch.py -m 'extract_patches'` 

##### <a name="step7"></a> 7. extract cell trajectories based on instance segmentation, see method `pipeline.patch_VAE.extract_patches` or `run_patch.py -m 'build_trajectories'` 

##### <a name="step8"></a> 8. train a VAE for cell patch latent-encoding, see method `run_training.py`

##### <a name="step9"></a> 9. assemble cell patches generated from step 7 to model-compatible datasets, see method `pipeline.patch_VAE.assemble_VAE` or `run_VAE.py -m 'assemble'`

##### <a name="step10"></a> 10. Generate latent representations for cell patches using trained VAE models, see method `pipeline.patch_VAE.process_VAE` or `run_VAE.py -m 'process'` 


## Usage

The dataset accompanying this repository is large and currently available upon request for demonstration. 

Scripts `run_preproc.py`, `run_segmentation.py`, `run_patch.py`, `run_VAE.py` and `run_training.py` provide command line interface to run each module. For details please check by using the `-h` option.
Each CLI requires a configuration file (.yaml format) that contains parameters for each stage.  Please see the example: `configs/config_example.yml`

To run the dynamorph pipeline, data should first be assembled into 5-D numpy arrays ([step 3](#step3)). 

Semantic segmentation ([step 4](#step4)) and instance segmentation ([step 5](#step5))):

	python run_segmentation.py -m "segmentation" -c <path-to-your-config-yaml>
	python run_segmentation.py -m "instance_segmentation" -c <path-to-your-config-yaml>

Extract patches from segmentation results ([step 6](#step6)), then connect them into trajectories ([step 7](#step7)):

	python run_patch.py -m "extract_patches" -c <path-to-your-config-yaml>
	python run_patch.py -m "build_trajectories" -c <path-to-your-config-yaml>
	
Train a DNN model (VQ-VAE) to learn a representation of your image data ([step 8](#step8)):

	python run_training.py -c <path-to-your-config-yaml>

Transform image patches into DNN model (VQ-VAE) latent-space by running inference. ([step 9](#step9) and [10](#step10)):

	python run_VAE.py -m "assemble" -c <path-to-your-config-yaml>
	python run_VAE.py -m "process" -c <path-to-your-config-yaml>

Reduce the dimension of latent vectors for visualization by fitting a PCA or UMAP model to the data. For PCA:

    python run_dim_reduction.py -m "pca" -c <path-to-your-config-yaml>
